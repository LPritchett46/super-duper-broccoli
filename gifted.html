    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Since the beginning of humanity, we have looked up into the night sky and asked,"What is above us?" Now, we are getting closer to the answer. Space Exploration is one of the most fascinating studies of science. People have thought of many ways to leave our planet, from dropping bombs behind a ship to riding a massive elevator off the Earth. However, space exploration is very challenging, with many obstacles standing between us and the great unknown. This website will show you the history, methods, and challenges of space travel, as well as current out-of-this-world events. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <p>The history of space exploration begins in the cold war, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were in a state of political hostility towards one another. During the cold war, they had a "space race," in which each one attempted to be the first to put a man in space. On October 4th, 1957, the soviets launched Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite. 4 years later, on April 12th, 1961, Yuri Gagarin was launched into space by the soviets, winning them the space race.
