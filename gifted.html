      <p>Since the beginning of humanity, we have looked up into the night sky and asked,"What is above us?" Now, we are getting closer to the answer. Space Exploration is one of the most fascinating studies of science. People have thought of many ways to leave our planet, from dropping bombs behind a ship to riding a massive elevator off the Earth. However, space exploration is very challenging, with many obstacles standing between us and the great unknown. This website will show you the history, methods, and challenges of space travel, as well as current out-of-this-world events. Enjoy!</p>
